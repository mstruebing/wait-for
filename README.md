# Wait-For

A rust utility to wait that a program exits with 0.

You need to wait for something to start up and don't know when it finishes?
You want to chain some other commands after it?

I've wrote it so that I can start docker, wait for it to boot up and run some commands once it's started
without the need to finish:

Just run: `wait-for docker ps && npm run <script> && npm run <other-script>` or anything alike.

Or you want to run something when an URL becomes available:

`wait-for 'curl --fail <non-existing-url>' && ./script.sh `
