# Waitz

A rust utility to wait that a program exits with 0.

You need to wait for something to start up and don't know when it finishes?
You want to chain some other commands after it? You want to run a bunch of commands and drink a coffee?
Than this is a tool for you.

I initially wrote it to start docker and run some processes after it, but you can do way more with it,
like waiting for a specific URL to become available after booting up a server in the background or anything else.

- `waitz docker ps && npm run <script> && npm run <other-script>`
- `waitz 'curl --fail <non-existing-url>' && ./script.sh`
